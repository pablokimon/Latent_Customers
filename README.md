Rainbow Grocery is a 25,000 square foot Natural Food store that does about $1,000,000 in sale per week.
They have been a fixture of San Francisco since 1975 and have a register system designed in the 80's.
Rainbow is unique in that is 
* vegetarian, 
* maintains a selection of 30,000 items, 
*emphasis on fresh produce, 
* bulk ingredients (from oats to beans and spices to teas)
* extensive supplements and body care sections

## Discovering customer types from transactions without a loyalty program!
Rainbow has no loyalty program as of Spring 2019.
Everyday the register spits out a giant text file (2000 printable pages everyday) of the 2000-3000 daily transactions.

Can we use data science to make sense of this stream of text and find the types of shoppers?
